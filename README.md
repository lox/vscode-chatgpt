# ChatGPT Plugin for VSCode

This VSCode extension integrates OpenAI's powerful language model, ChatGPT, into your coding workflow. With this extension, you can share your VSCode editor with ChatGPT, allowing it to assist you in various ways.

## Operations

- **Code Explanation**: Ask ChatGPT to explain what a specific piece of code does, and it will provide a detailed explanation.
- **Code Modification**: ChatGPT can make changes to your code with the modifyTab operation, ensuring the correct line and character offsets from the latest outline of the code.
